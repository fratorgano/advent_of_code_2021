# 🎄 Advent of Code 2021 🎄

I decided to stick with Rust this year and try to improve a bit on it, I basically haven't used it since last year's AoC so you could say 
I'm a bit RUSTy with it 🥶.

I'm not gonna shoot for the leaderboard, the goal is getting all the 50 ⭐ while learning and having fun. 

I'll try my best to get every ⭐ withing 24 hours of the puzzle release.

## ❄️ How to use ❄️
`cargo run -p day*` - Runs a specific day

`cargo test -p day*` - Tests a specific day

`cargo test` - Tests all

## 🎅 Have a Wonderful Holiday Season Everyone! 🎅
